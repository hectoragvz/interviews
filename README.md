## Data Structures

---

### Arrays

An array, also called a list in other programming languages, is a data structure allowing the storage of values in continuous spaces of memory.
You can store different types of values such as integers, floats, objects or even other arrays (creating 2D or nd arrays) in them.
In PYTHON, lists are implemented as DYNAMIC ARRAYS, meaning you dont´t need to specify the size of the arrays when declaration is performed.

_Time Complexity:_

- Lookup notation by index = O(1)
- Lookup by value = O(n)
- Array traversal = O(n)
- Array insertion = O(n)
- Array deletion = O(n)

### Linked Lists

Best explanation I found on topic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0) - Intro to data structures section

Contrary to arrays, which store values on continuous memory location, linked lists store values on random memory locations but each of those also store a reference to the next value in memory.
When we add elements for example, we would just need to change the address located in the element prior to the one we are adding.
We don´t need to preallocate space and insertio is easier.

A <em>double link list</em> would have elements store an address for the element before and after their location.

Link lists are not built in for Python, so there is a need to implement them.

_Time Complexity:_

- Add last element = O(1)
- Remove las element = O(n)
- Linked list traversal = O(n)
- Insert/delete at beginning = O(1)
- Insert/delete at an iterator position O(1)
- Lookup by value = O(n)

### Stacks

The stack data structure is a collection of elements that highlight two basic operations: push (adding elements to the stack) and pop (deleting elements from the stack).

Implements the last-In, First-Out approach, also called LIFO, which states the most recently added element will be removed frist from the strucutre.

_Time Complexity:_

- Search = O(n)
- Access = O(n)
- Insert and Delete (push and pop) - O(1)

### Queues

Consider the stack data structure but now, the element we aim to remove is the first on a queue - FIFO (First In, First Out approach).
We now call push-add as <em>enqueue</em> and pop-delete as <em>dequeue</em>. The end were elements are added is called tail or back of the queue and the end where elements are removed is called as front or head of the queue.
You can think about a queue as a line of customers waiting for a service.

_Time Complexity:_

- Search = O(n)
- Access = O(n)
- Insert and Delete (enqueue and dequeue) - O(1)

<em>Linear</em> data structures (linked lists, queues, and stacks) are formed by sequential data. We can access each element inside of them in a single pass and have as single level of information. In <em>non-linear</em> data structures (trees and graphs), we have multiple levels of information and we may not be able to access all the elements of the ds in a single pass.

### Tree

Trees are non-linear data structures (opposite to those mentioned above). Trees have a collection of entities called nodes, and their objective is to represent the relantionships between these. The connections between nodes are called edges.

The key terms to understand trees are listed in the image below, as posted by <em>geeksforgeeks</em>:

![Tree data structure](./assets/Treedatastructure.png "Tree data structure")

Some keys to remember about trees:

- If a tree has n nodes, it will have n-1 edges
- Degree of a node: number of children
- Degree of tree: the highest degree out of any node in the tree will be the degree of the tree
- Level of tree: levels of nodes in a tree starting from 0
- Height of a node: Out of the longest path from the node to any leaf node, the number of edges in that path
- Height of a tree: height of the root node
- Depth of a node: number of edges from the root node to a particular node
- Depth of a tree: number of edges from the root node in the longest path

### General Tree

Type of tree where each node can have any number of child nodes.

### Binary Tree

In this type of tree, each node may have <em>at most</em> 2 children, or resulting nodes (called binary for this reason). These are the different types of binary trees:

- Full: every node has 0 or 2 children
- Complete: All the levels of the tree except for the last are filled, and are filled from left to right
- Perfect: All internal nodes have 2 children and all leaves are in the same level
- Balanced: A balanced binary tree is such a tree whose left and right subtrees' heights differ by not more than 1
- Pathological: Every parent has only 1 child node

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

The traits that define a Binary Search Tree (BST) are:

1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys or values that are less than the parent´s value.
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys or values that are greater than the parent´s value.
3. Both the left and the right subtree must be BSTs.

_Time Complexity:_

- Search = O(log (n))
- Access = O(log (n))
- Insert and Delete = O(log (n))

#### Travsersing a Binary Tree

Traversing a tree means to visit the nodes in a particular order.

- **Pre-order Traversal**
  The following operadions are performed recursively at each node:

1. Visit the root node
2. Traversing the left-subtree
3. Traversing the right-subtree

- **Inorder Traversal**
  The following operations are performed recursively at each node:

1. Traversing the left sub-tree
2. Visit the root node
3. Traversing the right sub-tree

- **Post-Order Traversal**
  The following operations are performed recursively at each node:

1. Traversing the left sub-tree
2. Traversing the right sub-tree
3. Visit the root node

### Binary Heap

A binary heap is a complete (All the levels of the tree except for the last are filled, and are filled from left to right) binary tree which satisfies the heap property: property of a node in which the key of every parent node to be lesser than or equal to OR greater than or equal to the child´s node key.

- min heap / min binary heap
  complete binary tree where the key of every parent node is less than or equal to the cild node´s key
- max hap / max binary heap
  complete binary tree where the key of every parent node is greater than or equal to the cild node´s key

#### Heapify

a process to rearrange the elements of the heap in order to maintain the heap priority - commonly used to create a binary heap from a binary tree. Used in:

- Insertion operation
- Deletion operation
- While creating a binary heap from a given array

* Heapify Up: follows the bottom-up approach, we make sure heap properties are followed from bottom to top.

* Heapify Down: follows the top-down approach. We check the heap properties from top to bottom.

You can construct binary heap via Python lists. In a list of elements:

- ith element -> list[i]
- parent of ith element -> (i-1)//2
- children of ith element -> left: (2*i)+1 / right: (2*i)+2

### Tries (prefix Tree)

Tries are most commonly used to represent characters that form words in the way of a tree.

### Graph

A tree will always be a graph, but not all graphs are trees.

We can represent a graph by G = (V, E) where:

- G: graph
- V: set of vertices
- E: set of edges
- (): ordered pair
- {}: unordered pair

The two main categories of graphs are:

1. Undirected graph: A graph from which all of its edges are bi-directional

2. Directed graph: A graph from which all of its edges are uni-directional

## Algorithms

### Quick Sort

The key to the quicksort algorithm is to try to place a predefined pivot element in the list and place all smaller values to the left and all greater values to the right of it. When hat happens, quicksort will run recursively for each sublist and the final output will be a sorted list.

To select a pivot elemtn from the list you can:

- Pick the first element (program implemented in code [here]("./algorithms/sort/quickSort.py))
- Pick the last element
- Pick a random element
- Pick the middle element

_Time Complexity:_

- Best case = O(n log (n))
- Average Case = O(n log (n))
- Worst case = O(n\*\*2) - check [randomized quicksort]("./algorithms/sort/randomizedQS.py) to compensate this case
