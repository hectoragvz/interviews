# Big O Notation

for coding interviews

## What is even big O complexity?

Is a way for us to measure how our time of execution grows in relation to the size of the input

- we mean the worst case scenario for the most part

## Big O of 1

No matter how our input grows, the time is always the same

1. Remove or add from the end of an array
2. Look at an index from an array
3. Inserting in a map
4. Lookup in a hashmap
   ...

## Big O of n

As our input gros, our time grows equally

1. Looping
2. Insert or remove in the middle
3. Sliding window is O(n)
   ...

## Big O of n\*\*2

For when looping through multiple loops

## Big O of (n\*m)

Wehan dealing with different sizes of loops for instance 3 rows 2 cols

## Log O(n)

Applied to binary search or the binary search tree

2 to the power of x is equals to n

When dividing by two

Adding the rest when having more than 2 days to prepare.
