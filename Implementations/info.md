# Overview

## Arrays

### Data Structures

1. Arrays
2. Stacks
3. Queues
4. Hash Maps and Hash Sets

For this folder, I will keep the implementation of arrays, stacks, and queues limited to their respective array implementation.

5. Linked Lists

Must implement basic operations from scratch

6. Trees

Must implement from scratch

### Algorithms

1. Sliding Window (fixed and varied)
2. Two Pointers (Linked Lists included)
3. Binary Search (implemented from scratch)
